    <string name="ulysses_vision">
        We believe that productivity isn’t just about doing more—it’s about doing what matters most with unwavering commitment.
        In a world full of distractions, staying focused has become a challenge, and many struggle to achieve their goals because of interruptions, procrastination, and lack of accountability.
        \n\n
        Our vision is to redefine productivity by creating an ecosystem where individuals can lock in their commitments, eliminate distractions, and achieve their full potential. We are not just developing an app; we are building a mindset—one that embraces the power of the Ulysses Pact as a tool for self-discipline and success.
        \n\n
        Just as the ancient Greek hero Ulysses tied himself to the mast to resist temptation, our platform empowers users to pre-commit to their tasks, ensuring that their focus remains unshaken. We see a future where people no longer rely on willpower alone but instead set up systems that guarantee their success.
