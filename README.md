# Ulysses: **A Promise to Your Future Self.**
Ulysses is an Android application designed to help you regain control of your digital life. Inspired by the ancient myth where Ulysses tied himself to his ship's mast to resist the Sirens' call, this app allows you to make a binding pact with your future self by locking away distracting apps and tracking your usage.

## ✨ Features

* **Activity Tracking Dashboard:** Monitor your digital habits with precise analytics. Track total screen time, notifications, device unlocks, and view week-by-week statistics of open attempts and prevention rates for specific apps.
* **The Ulysses Pact (Timeout):** Select distracting apps and lock them away for a custom duration (1 Day, 3 Days, 1 Week, 1 Month, or a specific calendar date and time). 
* **Final Commitment Engine:** Once a lock is set and the "Final Commitment" is accepted, the decision is ironclad. The app prevents impulsive changes, ensuring you follow through on your self-imposed screen time limits until the timer expires.
* **Integrated Productivity Tools:** Beyond just app blocking, Ulysses includes built-in Notes and Alarm functionalities right from the bottom navigation bar to keep your workflow centralized.
* **Emergency Access:** A built-in emergency bypass ensures safety is never compromised while you are locked out of your standard apps.
